# Core CMS v0.3.0: Themes, Roles, and a Polished Admin Experience

**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Release:** v0.3.0

---

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Core CMS v0.3.0**. This update represents a major leap forward in usability, customization, and security. While v0.2.0 laid the foundation for content creation, v0.3.0 turns the system into a fully managed platform ready for diverse teams and designs.

Here is what's new in this release.

### 🎨 The Theme System
One of the most requested features is now live. You are no longer stuck with a single hardcoded look.
*   **Theme Manager**: Switch between visual designs instantly from the Admin Dashboard.
*   **Dark Mode**: We've included a "Dark Mode" theme out of the box to demonstrate the system's flexibility.
*   **Developer Friendly**: Creating a new theme is as simple as adding a folder to `/themes`. Check out the new `Theme Builder Guide` in the docs.

### 👥 User Roles & Security
As teams grow, security becomes paramount. We have implemented a strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system.
*   **Administrators**: Have full control (Settings, Plugins, Users).
*   **Editors**: Can manage content and media but cannot touch system configurations.
*   **Subscribers**: Read-only access (ready for future membership features).
*   **User Management**: Admins can now Add, Edit, and Delete users directly from the dashboard.

### ⚙️ Site Identity & Customization
You shouldn't need to write PHP just to change your logo.
*   **Site Identity**: Update your Site Title, Logo, and Footer Text directly in *Site Settings*.
*   **Label Editor**: Want to change "Read More" to "Discover"? You can now override UI text strings via the admin panel—perfect for branding or simple localization.
*   **Scroll to Top**: A configurable "Back to Top" button to improve navigation on long pages.

### 🖼️ Media & Editor Upgrades
Content creation gets smoother and more accessible.
*   **Media Metadata**: You can now add **Alt Text**, Titles, and Descriptions to your images for better SEO and accessibility.
*   **Editor.js Image Tool**: Drag and drop images directly into your posts using the block editor.
*   **Menu Enhancements**: Reorder menu links manually and link to internal pages by ID (so links don't break if you rename a slug).

### 📊 A Modern Dashboard
We've refreshed the Admin Dashboard. The old text links are gone, replaced by a responsive **Quick Actions Grid** that makes navigating the backend faster and more touch-friendly.

### 🚀 What's Next?
With the core experience now robust and customizable, we are officially moving to **Phase 5**. The next major update will introduce the **Event Planner Plugin**, transforming Core CMS into a specialized tool for managing events and bookings.
