# Introducing Core CMS: A Lightweight, Modular Foundation for the AI Era

I am excited to announce that I have officially made my latest project, **Core CMS**, public on GitHub.

For a long time, I've felt that modern Content Management Systems have become too heavy. They often come packed with features you never use, frameworks that require a steep learning curve, and bloat that slows down the "heartbeat" of your website.

I wanted to build something different. Something that returns to the roots of clean, procedural PHP, but architected for the future of AI integration.

### 🌟 The Philosophy: "The Star in the Core"

The concept behind Core CMS is simple: **The Core should be the Brain.**

If we treat a CMS like a human body:
*   **The Core** is the Central Nervous System. It handles the logic, routing, and security. It keeps the lights on.
*   **The Database** is the Memory (Hippocampus).
*   **Plugins** are Learned Skills. Just as learning to play the piano doesn't change your DNA, adding an Event Planner shouldn't hack your core files.

This separation of concerns ensures that the system remains fast, secure, and incredibly stable, no matter how many "skills" (plugins) you teach it.

### 🛠️ Under the Hood

Core CMS is built with a "No Framework" approach to ensure maximum performance and understanding:

*   **PHP 8.3+**: Utilizing the latest features for speed and type safety.
*   **MySQL (MariaDB)**: Robust data storage using secure PDO Prepared Statements.
*   **Block-Based Editing**: Integrated **Editor.js** for a modern writing experience that saves clean JSON data (perfect for AI parsing) instead of messy HTML blobs.
*   **Zero Bloat**: No heavy frontend frameworks. Just clean HTML5 and CSS3.

### 🚀 What's Built So Far?

We have just completed **Phase 4 (Expansion)**, meaning the system is now a fully functional CMS:

*   ✅ **Secure Authentication**: Login, Logout, and Session management.
*   ✅ **Content Management**: Create, Edit, and Delete Posts and Pages.
*   ✅ **Taxonomy**: Organize content with hierarchical Categories and Tags.
*   ✅ **Media Library**: Upload and manage images securely.
*   ✅ **User Profiles**: Manage accounts and avatars.
*   ✅ **Dynamic Menus**: Control your site navigation directly from the Admin Dashboard.

### 🔮 What's Next?

The roadmap is ambitious. Now that the foundation is solid, we are moving into **Phase 5**, where we will build the **Event Planner Plugin**—a specialized module for managing bookings and vendors.

Beyond that, Core CMS is designed to be **AI-Native**. Future phases include:
*   **Admin Copilot**: An AI assistant to help draft content and summarize data.
*   **Frontend Agents**: Chatbots that can query the database to answer visitor questions.

### 🔗 Check it Out

The repository is now open source. I invite you to explore the code, read the documentation, and see how a modern, lightweight CMS is built from scratch.
