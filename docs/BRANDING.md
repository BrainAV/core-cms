# 🎨 Branding Guidelines

## 1. Visual Identity

### The Logo Concept: "The Star in the Core"
The visual representation of **Core CMS** is based on a powerful natural metaphor:
*   **The Object**: An apple core, sliced horizontally.
*   **The Reveal**: In nature, this slice reveals a perfect 5-point star shape in the center.
*   **The Energy**: The star is surrounded by a radiating sunburst, symbolizing the **Solar Plexus** (the center of power and metabolism).
*   **Assets**: Rough logo saved as `assets/images/logo.png`.

### Color Palette
*   **Deep Navy (`#1c2a38`)**: Represents the depth and stability of the backend.
*   **Solar Gold**: Represents the energy of the core.
*   **Organic Green**: Represents growth and the plugin ecosystem.

## 2. The Philosophy: "Core" as "Corps"

We view the CMS not as a machine, but as a living organism (*Corps* is French for Body).

*   **The Solar Plexus (Database)**: The center of it all. It takes "Input" (Food), digests it, and distributes energy to the rest of the system.
*   **The Limbs (Plugins)**: Extensions that allow the body to interact with the world (Event Planner, Engagement).
*   **The Organs (AI Agents)**:
    *   **The Brain**: Generates content and structure.
    *   **The Voice**: Handles external communication (Chat).
    *   **The Glands**: Regulate system health and immunity (Security/Spam).

## 3. AI Generation Prompts

Use the following prompt with Gemini (Imagen 3) or other image generators to create the official logo assets.

### 🍌 "Nano Banana" Prompt (Logo)
> **Prompt:**
> "A minimalist, modern tech logo design. A horizontal cross-section of an apple core, revealing the natural 5-point star shape inside. The star is glowing gold. The surrounding apple flesh is stylized and geometric, forming a subtle sunburst or solar plexus chakra symbol. Deep navy blue background. Vector art style, flat design, clean lines, organic yet structured. High quality, professional software branding."

### Icon Prompt (Favicon)
> **Prompt:**
> "A simple gold 5-point star inside a geometric circle, flat vector icon, navy blue background, app icon style."
