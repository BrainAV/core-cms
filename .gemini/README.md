# 🎨 Themes Directory

This folder contains custom themes for Core CMS.

## Structure
Each theme should be in its own subfolder (e.g., `themes/dark-mode/`) and mirror the structure of the default `templates/` folder.

*   `header.php`
*   `footer.php`
*   `404.php`
*   (Optional) `home.php`, `page.php`, etc.

The **Default Theme** lives in the root `templates/` directory of the CMS.
